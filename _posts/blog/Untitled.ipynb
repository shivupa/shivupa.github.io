    "A side project that I've recently been working (or trying to work) on is coding a fast molecular integral library in c. An important function in the calculation of coulombic integrals is the Boys function, $F_n(x)$. This function is given by:\n",
    "$$ F_n(x) = \\int_0^1 e^{-xt^2} t^{2n} dt $$\n",
    "Evaluating this function frequently, accurately and quickly has been a focus of research for about the last half a century. I'll present a simple example here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation of the Boys function can be broken into two cases, large $x$ values and small $x$ values.\n",
    "# Large $x$ values:\n",
    "\n",
    "For large x values the boys function can be approximated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_n(x) = \\int_0^1 e^{-xt^2} t^{2n} dt \\approx \\int_0^\\infty e^{-xt^2} t^{2n} dt $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is related to the incomplete gamma integral and can be integrated giving:\n",
    "$$F_n(x) \\approx \\frac{(2n-1)!!}{2^{n+1}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{x^{2n+1}}} \\quad (x\\ \\mathrm{large})$$\n",
    "# Small $x$ values:\n",
    "To approximate the boys function for small $x$ values a Taylor expansion is employed:\n",
    "$$F_n(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-x)^k}{k!(2n+2k+1)}$$\n",
    "An infinite series is impractical in application (obviously) so this is truncated to six terms to achieve reasonable accuracy in reasonable time.\n",
    "# Where does $x$ become large?\n",
    "This is a question which has been bothering me, but for now I sidestepped the issue by returning the lowest value calculated by the two methods.\n",
    "# Potential speed ups\n",
    "* I'm calculating both expressions each time which is really bad\n",
    "* I'm not implementing any recursion formula\n",
    "The later point is critical what I should be doing is calculating the Boys function at a very high order $n$ on a grid of $x$ points and using a downward recursion formula (upwards recursion is numerical unstable at smal $x$ values).\n",
